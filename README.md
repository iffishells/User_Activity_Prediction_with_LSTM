# User_Activity_Prediction_with_LSTM
**Project Title:** User Activity Prediction with LSTM

**Description:**
This project focuses on predicting user activity, specifically the next 100 student logins, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset comprises records of user login/logout times, cluster names, and the number of users. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model leveraging TensorFlow's LSTM architecture.

**Key Features:**
- Predicts the next 100 student logins based on historical data.
- Utilizes TensorFlow's LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting.
- Includes Jupyter Notebook showcasing the model training, testing, and evaluation pipelines.
- Provides model checkpoints for future use and deployment.

**Project Structure:**
- **Dataset:** Contains the provided dataset (UserLog.csv.zip).
- **Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter Notebooks for model development and evaluation.
- **Models:** Stores trained model checkpoints.
- **README.md:** Offers an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

**Usage:**
1. Download the dataset and extract it into the "Dataset" directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files to train and evaluate the models.
3. Check the "Models" directory for saved model checkpoints.
4. Deploy the trained model for predicting future student logins.
